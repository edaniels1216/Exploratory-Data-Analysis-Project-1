# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-1

This is a submission for the first project of the Exploratory Data Analysis section of the JHU R Programming course. 

# This data describes the electric power consumption data for one household over the course of 4 years.

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

# Please note that: 

- The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).

- We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.

- You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.

- Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as " ? ".
